# TutorialEdge.net Community  üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Welcome to the TutorialEdge codebase! 

## What is TutorialEdge.net?


I've been working on TutorialEdge.net as a hobby project since early 2015. Since
then it's gone from only a handful of visitors per day to something that
attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors per year.

The main aim for the site is for it to be a place that I can host tutorials and
courses on any language and framework I choose and hopefully give back something
to the programming community.
