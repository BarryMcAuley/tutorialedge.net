In this course I'll be demonstrating the absolute fundamentals to developing
applications with AngularJS 1.X. We'll begin by creating a very simple admin
application that will perform multiple tasks such as consuming RESTful APIs,
Lazy Loading articles and more.

We’ll begin by creating some very simple Single Page Applications or SPAs and
then build up on these until we’ve covered everything you need in order to
develop your own web applications using the AngularJS framework.
