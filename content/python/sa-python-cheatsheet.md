For the majority of my development career I have been an application developer, and I thoroughly enjoyed writing applications and not worrying so much about the hardware and networking components upon which my applications sat. 

However, over the past year, I have been thrown into the deep end of a far lower level of software engineering than I was previously used to. I have been working on a fairly substantial project which has brought me down into the mirky depths of network rules and VM management. This typically meant moving away from building larger applications that clients directly interacted with and moving more towards writing scripts and deployment pipelines using Python.

# Iterating Over Files in a Directory

# Creating and Deleting Files

# Encrypting and Decrypting Files

# Moving Files

# Looking up DNS Records

# Testing Connectivity

# Working with Environment Variables

# Conclusion
