In this series, we are going to be looking at how you can build a real-time chat system using Vue.JS for the frontend and Node.JS for the backend. 

By the end of this series, we'll have covered topics such as animations, WebSockets and communication from a frontend application to a backend application. We'll also be taking a look at how we can deploy our application on top of AWS.
