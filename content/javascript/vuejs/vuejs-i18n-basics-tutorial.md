In this tutorial, we are going to look at how you can introduce internationalization into your Vue.js applications using the `vue-i18n` library.


# What is i18n?

If you are trying to build a global audience for your application then being able to cater for a huge number of different languages within your application is a huge win. Thankfully, **i18n** makes this a lot easier for us by giving us a standard format for defining translations within our application's codebase which can then be quickly swapped in and out depending on the users preference.

```json
{
    "en" : {
        "hello": "Hello"
    }, 
    "es" : {
        "hello": "Hola!"
    }
}

<button class="btn btn-primary">Hello</button>

<button class="btn btn-primary">Hola!</button>
